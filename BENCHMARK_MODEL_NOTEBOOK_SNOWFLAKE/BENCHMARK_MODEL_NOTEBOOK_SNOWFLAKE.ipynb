    "The objective of this challenge is to build a robust **machine learning model** capable of predicting water quality across various river locations in South Africa. In addition to accurate predictions, the model should also identify and emphasize the key factors that significantly influence water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants will be provided with a dataset containing three water quality parameters — **Total Alkalinity**, **Electrical Conductance**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus** — collected between 2011 and 2015 from approximately 200 river locations across South Africa. Each data point includes the geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the sampling site, the date of collection, and the corresponding water quality measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this dataset, participants are expected to build a machine learning model to predict water quality parameters for a separate validation dataset, which includes locations from different regions not present in the training data. The challenge also encourages participants to explore feature importance and provide insights into the factors most strongly associated with variations in water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is designed for participants with varying levels of experience in data science, remote sensing, and environmental analytics. It offers a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to real-world environmental data and contribute to advancing water quality monitoring using artificial intelligence.\n"

    "In this notebook, we demonstrate a basic workflow that serves as a foundation for the challenge. The model has been developed to predict **water quality parameters** using features derived from the **Landsat** and **TerraClimate** datasets. Specifically, four spectral bands — **SWIR22** (Shortwave Infrared 2), **NIR** (Near Infrared), **Green**, and **SWIR16** (Shortwave Infrared 1) — were utilized from Landsat, along with derived spectral indices such as **NDMI** (Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and **MNDWI** (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index). In addition, the **PET** (Potential Evapotranspiration) variable was incorporated from the **TerraClimate** dataset to account for climatic influences on water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset spans a five-year period from **2011 to 2015**. Using **API-based data extraction** methods, both Landsat and TerraClimate features were retrieved directly from the [Microsoft Planetary Computer portal](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "These combined spectral, index-based, and climatic features were used as predictors in a regression model to estimate three key water quality parameters: **Total Alkalinity (TA)**, **Electrical Conductance (EC)**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP)**.\n",

    "Please note that this notebook serves only as a starting point. Several assumptions were made during the data extraction and model development process, which you may find opportunities to improve upon. Participants are encouraged to explore additional features, enhance preprocessing techniques, or experiment with different regression algorithms to optimize predictive performance.\n"

Participants can refer to the dedicated extraction notebooks—one for Landsat and another for TerraClimate—to understand how the data was retrieved and processed, and they can also generate their own output CSV files if needed.

    "## Helper Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train and Test Split\n",
    "We will now split the data into 70% training data and 30% test data. Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a robust library for machine learning in Python. The `model_selection` module in scikit-learn provides the `train_test_split` function, which can be used for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Scaling\n",
    "Before initiating model training, we may need to perform various data preprocessing steps. Here, we demonstrate scaling of the variables **SWIR22**, **NDMI**, **MNDWI**, and **PET** using StandardScaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature scaling is an essential preprocessing step for numerical features. Many machine learning algorithms—such as gradient descent methods, KNN, and linear or logistic regression—require scaling to achieve optimal performance. Scikit-learn provides several scaling utilities. In this notebook, we use **StandardScaler**, which transforms the data so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "Now that we have the data in a format suitable for machine learning, we can begin training our models. In this demonstration notebook, we build three separate regression models—one for each target water quality parameter: **Total Alkalinity**, **Electrical Conductance**, and **Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus**. Each model is trained independently to capture the unique relationships between the satellite-derived features and each water quality parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the **Random Forest Regressor** from the scikit-learn library for model training. Scikit-learn offers a wide range of regression algorithms, along with powerful parameter tuning and customization options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For model training, the predictor variables (e.g., SWIR22, NDMI, MNDWI, and PET) are stored in an array `X`, and the response variable (one of the water quality parameters) is stored in an array `Y`. Note that the response variable should not be included in `X`. Also, latitude, longitude, and sample date are excluded from the predictor variables since they serve only as spatial and temporal references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "After training the models for the three water quality parameters, the next step is to evaluate their performance. Each regression model—Total Alkalinity, Electrical Conductance, and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus—is assessed using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R² Score**: Measures how well the model explains the variance in the observed values.  \n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: Quantifies the average magnitude of prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these metrics help determine how effectively each model captures variations in water quality across locations and sampling dates. Scikit-learn provides built-in functions to compute both metrics. Participants may also explore additional evaluation techniques or custom metrics to enhance model assessment.\n"
